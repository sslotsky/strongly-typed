# Strongly Typed

A game to test your typing chops.

You're an employee at a tech company, and with each passing day, new tech trends and cloud services go speeding through your universe at an alarming rate. Your competitors are learning to leverage them to increase their competitive edge. Failure to reign them into your own product is damaging your user base. The solution is clear: capture them all!

As cloud services and tech trends fall from the sky, you must type in their names before they crash into the base. Capturing words will increase your score, but if your base becomes completely destroyed, it's GAME OVER for your business! 

Don't forget to watch out for the bonus!
